# Why git

git is the almighty source control software out there. If you want to colaborate with your peers, change code without being worried it won't work later or even contribute to people/company projects, than git is the way. 

To get accostumate to git you just need to use it. It isn't one of those things that you can master right off the bat, so just keep pushing it and eventually you will find yourself confortable with it. So on this WS you will only get some basic commands you need to start using it.

Btw, git lives mostly on the command line! To install it you just need to write:

```console
$ sudo apt install git
```


## git clone
Clone is basically the copying a repository from other user and make you able to collaborate in it. To do it follow these steps:
Find a project->click on "<>Code"-> Copy the https link

Then just do:
```console
$ git clone *url*
```
Now you have access to this repository! If it is private you might need to set up the account, but that would be too long too post here so Google will have to help you :).


## commit

When you make changes and want to record them so you can go back earlier, you use commit. This will save the changes in your local repository. 

```$ git commit```

## push

After committing the latest changes, you already have saved the changes in your local repository. But now you want to **push** them to the remote repository for everyone to access! That is what git push does.

When doing it, you might be told you need to stash your changes before or even pull the most recent changes on the remote repository, it is an headache!

```$ git push```


## pull

Yeeeeah, you might not be the only one working on the same repository. Here is when git pull comes. It basically gets you the most recent changes on the remote repository!

```$ git pull```
